 # 1. INTRODUCTION
 
 ## 1.1 Overview
 
-This document describes an integrated set of technologies, protocols, identity-proofing, lifecycle management, and auditing requirements that are necessary (but not sufficient) for the issuance and management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates; Certificates that are trusted by virtue of the fact that their corresponding Root Certificate is distributed in widely-available application software. The requirements are not mandatory for Certification Authorities unless and until they become adopted and enforced by relying-party Application Software Suppliers.
-
-**Notice to Readers**
+This Certificate Policy ("CP") document outlines the certificate policies for Internet Security Research Group ("ISRG") Public Key Infrastructure ("ISRG PKI").
 
-The CP for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates describe a subset of the requirements that a Certification Authority must meet in order to issue Publicly Trusted Certificates. This document serves two purposes: to specify Baseline Requirements and to provide guidance and requirements for what a CA should include in its CPS. Except where explicitly stated otherwise, these Requirements apply only to relevant events that occur on or after 1 July 2012 (the original effective date of these requirements).
+ISRG PKI services include, but are not limited to, issuing, managing, validating, revoking, and renewing Certificates. ISRG PKI is operated in accordance with the requirements of this CP, and in a manner consistent with the ISRG Certification Practice Statement ("CPS").
 
-These Requirements do not address all of the issues relevant to the issuance and management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates. In accordance with RFC 3647 and to facilitate a comparison of other certificate policies and CPSs (e.g. for policy mapping), this document includes all sections of the RFC 3647 framework. However, rather than beginning with a "no stipulation" comment in all empty sections, the CA/Browser Forum is leaving such sections initially blank until a decision of "no stipulation" is made. The CA/Browser Forum may update these Requirements from time to time, in order to address both existing and emerging threats to online security. In particular, it is expected that a future version will contain more formal and comprehensive audit requirements for delegated functions.
+ISRG PKI services are provided to the general public with exceptions as deemed appropriate by ISRG management or in accordance with relevant law.
 
-These Requirements only address Certificates intended to be used for authenticating servers accessible through the Internet. Similar requirements for code signing, S/MIME, time-stamping, VoIP, IM, Web services, etc. may be covered in future versions.
+ISRG PKI services are most commonly, but not necessarily exclusively, provided under the brand/trademark "Let's Encrypt".
 
-These Requirements do not address the issuance, or management of Certificates by enterprises that operate their own Public Key Infrastructure for internal purposes only, and for which the Root Certificate is not distributed by any Application Software Supplier.
+The ISRG PKI conforms to the current version of the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates published at <http://www.cabforum.org>. In the event of any inconsistency between this document and those Requirements, those Requirements take precedence over this document.
 
-These Requirements are applicable to all Certification Authorities within a chain of trust. They are to be flowed down from the Root Certification Authority through successive Subordinate Certification Authorities.
+Other documents related to the behavior and control of the ISRG PKI, such as a Subscriber Agreement and Privacy Policy, can be found at <https://letsencrypt.org/repository/>.
 
-## 1.2 Document name and identification
+Per IETF PKIX RFC 3647, this CP is divided into nine components that cover security controls, practices, and procedures for certification services provided by the ISRG PKI.
 
-This certificate policy (CP) contains the requirements for the issuance and management of publicly-trusted SSL certificates, as adopted by the CA/Browser Forum.
+The following Certification Authorities are covered under this CP:
 
-The following Certificate Policy identifiers are reserved for use by CAs as an optional means of asserting compliance with this document (OID arc 2.23.140.1.2) as follows:

Version 2.0 of WebTrust's Principles and Criteria for Certification Authorities - SSL Baseline with Network Security and ETSI's Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI) 102 042 incorporate version 1.1.6 of these Baseline Requirements and version 1.0 of the Network and Certificate System Security Requirements. The CA/Browser Forum continues to improve the Baseline Requirements while WebTrust and ETSI also continue to update their audit criteria. We encourage all CAs to conform to each revision herein on the date specified without awaiting a corresponding update to an applicable audit criterion. In the event of a conflict between an existing audit criterion and a guideline revision, we will communicate with the audit community and attempt to resolve any uncertainty, and we will respond to implementation questions directed to <questions@cabforum.org>. Our coordination with compliance auditors will continue as we develop guideline revision cycles that harmonize with the revision cycles for audit criteria, the compliance auditing periods and cycles of CAs, and the CA/Browser Forum's guideline implementation dates.
