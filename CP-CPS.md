# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Overview

This combined Certificate Policy ("CP") and Certification Practice Statement ("CPS") document ("CP/CPS") outlines the certification services practices for Internet Security Research Group ("ISRG") Public Key Infrastructure ("ISRG PKI").

ISRG PKI services include, but are not limited to, issuing, managing, validating, revoking, and renewing publicly-trusted Certificates in a manner consistent with this CP/CPS.

These services are provided to the general public with exceptions as ISRG management deems appropriate or in accordance with relevant law.

ISRG PKI services are most commonly, but not necessarily exclusively, provided under the brand/trademark "Let's Encrypt".

The ISRG PKI conforms to the current version of the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates published at <https://www.cabforum.org>. In the event of any inconsistency between this document and those Requirements, those Requirements take precedence over this document.

Other documents related to the behavior and control of the ISRG PKI, such as a Subscriber Agreement and Privacy Policy, can be found at <https://letsencrypt.org/repository/>.

Per IETF PKIX RFC 3647, this CP/CPS is divided into nine components that cover security controls, practices, and procedures for certification services provided by the ISRG PKI.

The following Certification Authorities are covered under this document:

| CA Type | Distinguished Name | Key Pair Type and Parameters | Cert SHA-256 Fingerprint | Validity Period |

## 1.3 PKI Participants

### 1.3.1 Certification Authorities

This CP/CPS applies to the ISRG CA.

### 1.3.2 Registration Authorities

ISRG does not delegate any of the Section 3.2 requirements to a Delegated Third Party. ISRG serves as its own RA.

### 1.3.3 Subscribers

See definition of "Subscriber" in Section 1.6.1 Definitions.

### 1.3.4 Relying Parties

See definition of "Relying Party" in Section 1.6.1 Definitions.

### 1.3.5 Other Participants

Other participants include CAs that cross-sign or issue subordinates to the ISRG PKI.

ISRG PKI vendors and service providers with access to confidential information or privileged systems are required to operate in compliance with this ISRG CP/CPS.

## 1.4 Certificate Usage

### 1.4.1 Appropriate Certificate Uses

No stipulation.

### 1.4.2 Prohibited Certificate Uses

Certificates may not be used:

* For any application requiring fail-safe performance, such as: a) the operation of nuclear power facilities; b) air traffic control systems; c) aircraft navigation systems; d) weapons control systems; or e) any other system in which failure could lead to injury, death, or environmental damage.
* For software or hardware architectures that provide facilities for interference with encrypted communications, including but not limited to: a) active eavesdropping (e.g., monster-in-the-middle attacks); or b) traffic management of domain names or internet protocol addresses that the organization does not own or control. Note that these restrictions shall apply regardless of whether a relying party communicating through the software or hardware architecture has knowledge of its providing facilities for interference with encrypted communications.

Note that Certificates do not guarantee anything regarding reputation, honesty, or the current state of endpoint security. A Certificate only represents that the information contained in it was verified as reasonably correct when the Certificate was issued.

### 1.6.4 Conventions

Terms not otherwise defined in this CP/CPS shall be as defined in applicable agreements, user manuals, Certificate Policies, and Certification Practice Statements of the CA.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this CP/CPS shall be interpreted in accordance with RFC 2119.

# 2. PUBLICATION AND REPOSITORY RESPONSIBILITIES

## 2.1 Repositories

ISRG Combined CP/CPS, Privacy Policy, Subscriber Agreement, and WebTrust audit documents are made publicly available in the Policy and Legal Repository, which can be found at:

<https://letsencrypt.org/repository/>

## 2.2 Publication of information

Records of all ISRG Root and Subordinate CA certificates, including those that have been revoked, are available in the Certificate Repository:

<https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/>

ISRG certificates contain URLs to locations where certificate-related information is published, including revocation information via OCSP and/or CRLs.

## 2.3 Time or frequency of publication

New or updated ISRG Combined CP/CPS, Privacy Policy, Subscriber Agreement, and WebTrust audit documents are made publicly available as soon as possible. This typically means within seven days of receipt or approval. The ISRG PMA will approve and publish updated CP/CPS documents at least annually.

New or updated ISRG Root and Subordinate CA certificates are made publicly available as soon as possible. This typically means within seven days of creation.

## 2.4 Access controls on repositories

Read only access to the Policy and Legal Repository and certificate information is unrestricted. Write access is protected by logical and physical controls.

# 3. IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

## 3.1 Naming

### 3.1.1 Types of names

Certificate distinguished names and subject alternative names are compliant with the Baseline Requirements.

### 3.1.2 Need for names to be meaningful

ISRG certificates include a "Subject" field which identifies the subject entity (i.e. organization or FQDN). The subject entity is identified using a distinguished name.

ISRG certificates include an "Issuer" field which identifies the issuing entity. The issuing entity is identified using a distinguished name.

### 3.1.3 Anonymity or pseudonymity of subscribers

Subscribers are not identified in DV certificates, which have subject fields identifying only FQDNs (not people or organizations). Relying Parties should consider DV certificate Subscribers to be anonymous.

### 3.1.4 Rules for interpreting various name forms

Distinguished names in certificates are to be interpreted using X.500 standards and ASN.1 syntax.

Certificates do not assert any specific relationship between Subscribers and registrants of domain names contained in certificates.

Regarding Internationalized Domain Names, ISRG will have no objection so long as the domain is resolvable via DNS. It is the CA's position that homoglyph spoofing should be dealt with by registrars, and Web browsers should have sensible policies for when to display the punycode versions of names.

### 3.1.5 Uniqueness of names

No stipulation.

### 3.1.6 Recognition, authentication, and role of trademarks

ISRG reserves the right to make all decisions regarding Subscriber names in certificates. Entities requesting certificates will be required to demonstrate their right to use names (e.g. demonstrate control of an FQDN), but trademark rights are not verified.

While ISRG will comply with U.S. law and associated legal orders, it is ISRG's position that trademark enforcement responsibility for domain names should lie primarily with domain registrars and the legal system.

## 3.2 Initial identity validation

ISRG may elect not to issue any certificate at its sole discretion.

### 3.2.1 Method to prove possession of private key

Applicants are required to prove possession of the Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in a Certificate request by signing the CSR provided to the Finalize method of the ACME Protocol defined in RFC 8555, Section 7.4.

### 3.2.2 Authentication of Organization and Domain Identity

ISRG only issues Domain Validation (DV) certificates. All FQDNs which will be listed in the Common Name and list of SANs in the certificate are fully validated prior to issuance.

ISRG uses three methods for validating domain control:

1. DNS Change (Baseline Requirements Section 3.2.2.4.7)
2. Agreed-Upon Change to Website - ACME (Baseline Requirements Section 3.2.2.4.19)
3. TLS Using ALPN (Baseline Requirements Section 3.2.2.4.20)

Validation for Wildcard Domain Names must be completed using the DNS Change method.

All validations are performed in compliance with the current CAB Forum Baseline Requirements at the time of validation.

### 3.2.3 Authentication of individual identity

ISRG does not issue Subscriber Certificates containing Subject Identity Information, and thus does not validate any natural person's identity.

### 3.2.4 Non-verified subscriber information

Non-verified Applicant information is not included in ISRG certificates.

### 3.2.5 Validation of authority

ISRG does not issue Subscriber Certificates containing Subject Identity Information, and thus does not validate any natural person's authority to request certificates on behalf of organizations.

### 3.2.6 Criteria for Interoperation or Certification

ISRG discloses Cross Certificates in its Certificate Repository.

## 3.3 Identification and authentication for re-key requests

### 3.3.1 Identification and authentication for routine re-key

See Section 4.7.

### 3.3.2 Identification and authentication for re-key after revocation

See Section 4.7.

## 3.4 Identification and authentication for revocation request

Identification and authentication for revocation requests is performed by ISRG in compliance with Section 4.9 of this document.

Identification and authentication are not required when ISRG is requesting revocation.

# 4. CERTIFICATE LIFE-CYCLE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

## 4.1 Certificate Application

### 4.1.1 Who can submit a certificate application

Anyone may submit an application for a certificate via the ACME protocol. Issuance will depend on proper validation and compliance with ISRG policies.

### 4.1.2 Enrollment process and responsibilities

The enrollment process involves the following steps, in no particular order:

* Generating a key pair using secure methods
* Submitting a request for a certificate containing all necessary information, including the public key
* Agreeing to the relevant Subscriber Agreement

## 4.2 Certificate application processing

### 4.2.1 Performing identification and authentication functions

ISRG performs all identification and authentication functions in accordance with this CP/CPS. This includes validation per Section 3.2.2.

Certificate information is verified using data and documents obtained no more than 90 days prior to issuance of the Certificate.

As part of the issuance process, ISRG checks for CAA records and follows the processing instructions found, for each dNSName in the subjectAltName extension of the certificate to be issued, as specified in RFC 8659 and Section 3.2.2.8 of the Baseline Requirements. The CA acts in accordance with CAA records if present. If the CA issues, the CA will do so within the TTL of the CAA record, or 8 hours, whichever is greater. The CA's CAA identifying domain is `letsencrypt.org`.

ISRG maintains a list of high-risk domains and blocks issuance of certificates for those domains. Requests for removal from the high-risk domains list will be considered, but will likely require further documentation confirming control of the domain from the Applicant, or other proof as ISRG management deems necessary.

### 4.2.2 Approval or rejection of certificate applications

Approval requires successful completion of validation per Section 3.2.2 as well as compliance with all CA policies.

Certificates containing a new gTLD under consideration by ICANN will not be issued. The CA Server will periodically be updated with the latest version of the Public Suffix List and will consult the ICANN domains section for every requested DNS identifier. The CA server will not validate or issue for DNS identifiers that do not have a Public Suffix in the ICANN domains section.

### 4.2.3 Time to process certificate applications

No stipulation.

## 4.3 Certificate issuance

### 4.3.1 CA actions during certificate issuance

At a high level, the following steps are taken during issuance of a Subscriber Certificate. ISRG's automated processes confirm that all names which will appear in the Common Name and/or list of SANs of the certificate have been properly validated to be controlled by the Subscriber requesting the certificate. The certificate is signed by a Subordinate CA in an HSM. After issuance is complete, the certificate is stored in a database and made available to the Subscriber.

### 4.3.2 Notification to subscriber by the CA of issuance of certificate

Subscriber Certificates are made available to Subscribers via the ACME protocol as soon after issuance as reasonably possible. Typically this happens within a few seconds.

## 4.4 Certificate acceptance

### 4.4.1 Conduct constituting certificate acceptance

No stipulation.

### 4.4.2 Publication of the certificate by the CA

See Section 2.2 of this document for Root and Subordinate CA certificate publication information.

All Subscriber Certificates are made available to Subscribers via the ACME protocol.

For each Subscriber Certificate issuance, ISRG signs a Precertificate and submits it to a selection of Certificate Transparency logs. Upon successful submission, ISRG attempts to issue a certificate that matches the Precertificate (per RFC 6962 Section 3.1) and embeds at least two of the resulting Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs). ISRG submits the resulting final certificate to a selection of Certificate Transparency logs on a best-effort basis.

ISRG does not guarantee issuance of a final certificate for every Precertificate.

### 4.4.3 Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other entities

See Section 4.4.2.

## 4.5 Key pair and certificate usage

### 4.5.1 Subscriber private key and certificate usage

Subscriber usage of Private Keys and Certificates is governed by the Let's Encrypt Subscriber Agreement.

### 4.5.2 Relying party public key and certificate usage

Relying Parties should fully evaluate the context in which they are relying on certificates and the information contained in them, and decide to what extent the risk of reliance is acceptable. If the risk of relying on a certificate is determined to be unacceptable, then Relying Parties should not use the certificate or should obtain additional assurances before using the certificate.

ISRG does not warrant that any software used by Relying Parties to evaluate or otherwise handle certificates does so properly.

## 4.6 Certificate renewal

Certificate renewal requests are treated as applications for new certificates.

### 4.6.1 Circumstance for certificate renewal

No stipulation.

### 4.6.2 Who may request renewal

No stipulation.

### 4.6.3 Processing certificate renewal requests

No stipulation.

No stipulation.

## 4.9 Certificate revocation and suspension

### 4.9.1 Circumstances for revocation

ISRG will follow the Baseline Requirements and revoke a certificate in accordance with Section 4.9.1.1 and Section 4.9.1.2 of the Baseline Requirements.

### 4.9.2 Who can request revocation

Anyone can revoke any certificate via the ACME API if they can sign the revocation request with the private key associated with the certificate. No other information is required in such cases.

Anyone can revoke any certificate via the ACME API if they can demonstrate control over all FQDNs covered by the certificate. No other information is required in such cases.

Subscribers can revoke certificates belonging to their accounts via the ACME API if they can sign the revocation request with the associated account private key. No other information is required in such cases.

ISRG may administratively revoke certificates if it determines that the Subscriber has failed to meet obligations under this CP/CPS, the relevant Subscriber Agreement, or any other applicable agreement, regulation, or law. Certificates may also be administratively revoked at ISRG management's discretion.

### 4.9.3 Procedure for revocation request

Anyone may make revocation requests, at any time, via the Certificate Revocation interface of the ACME Protocol defined in RFC 8555 section 7.6. Successful revocation requests with a reason code of `keyCompromise` will result in the affected key being blocked for future issuance and all currently valid certificates with that key will be revoked, regardless of whether compromise was demonstrated per the requirements in Section 4.9.12 of this document.

Requests for revocation may also be made by emailing [cert-prob-reports@letsencrypt.org](mailto:cert-prob-reports@letsencrypt.org). ISRG maintains a continuous (24x7) ability to accept and respond to revocation requests and Certificate Problem Reports. ISRG will respond to such requests within 24 hours, though an investigation into the legitimacy of the request may take longer.

An investigation into whether revocation or other appropriate action is warranted will be based on at least the following criteria:

1. The nature of the alleged problem;
2. The number of Certificate Problem Reports received about a particular Certificate or Subscriber;
3. The entity making the complaint; and
4. Relevant legislation.

### 4.9.4 Revocation request grace period

There is no grace period for a revocation request. A revocation request must be made as soon as circumstances requiring revocation are confirmed.

### 4.9.5 Time within which CA must process the revocation request

Investigation into a revocation request will begin within 24 hours of receiving the request. Revocation, if necessary, will be carried out within the timeframes set by Baseline Requirements Sections 4.9.1.1 and 4.9.1.2.

### 4.9.6 Revocation checking requirement for relying parties

Relying Parties should verify the validity of certificates via CRL or OCSP prior to relying on certificates. Relying Parties who cannot or choose not to check certificate expiration or revocation status, but decide to rely on a certificate anyway, do so at their own risk.

See Section 4.5.2.

### 4.9.7 CRL issuance frequency (if applicable)

ISRG will issue updated CRLs with the frequency required by the Baseline Requirements.

### 4.9.8 Maximum latency for CRLs (if applicable)

When a Relying Party requests a CRL, the time to receive a response will be less than ten seconds under normal operating conditions.

### 4.9.9 On-line revocation/status checking availability

Revocation information will be made available for all Subscriber Certificates via OCSP. Revocation information may be made available for Subordinate CA certificates via OCSP.

### 4.9.10 On-line revocation checking requirements

ISRG provides OCSP responses in compliance with Baseline Requirements Section 4.9.10.

### 4.9.11 Other forms of revocation advertisements available

ISRG allows for OCSP stapling.

### 4.9.12 Special requirements re key compromise

Key compromise must be demonstrated via the Certificate Revocation method of the ACME Protocol defined in RFC 8555, Section 7.6 by signing the request using the private key corresponding to the public key in the certificate (not the private key corresponding to the account which originally requested the certificate).

### 4.9.13 Circumstances for suspension

ISRG does not suspend certificates.

### 4.9.14 Who can request suspension

Not applicable.

### 4.9.15 Procedure for suspension request

Not applicable.

### 4.9.16 Limits on suspension period

Not applicable.

## 4.10 Certificate status services

### 4.10.1 Operational characteristics

ISRG will retain revocation entries on a CRL or OCSP Response as required by the Baseline Requirements.

### 4.10.2 Service availability

All certificate status services are made available at all times (24x7) if possible.

### 4.10.3 Optional features

No stipulation.

## 4.11 End of subscription

A Subscriber's subscription ends once all of Subscriber's ISRG certificates have expired or been revoked.

Prior to expiration of a Subscriber's certificate, ISRG may send Subscriber a notice regarding upcoming Certificate expiration if a contact email address was provided.

## 4.12 Key escrow and recovery

### 4.12.1 Key escrow and recovery policy and practices

Not applicable.

### 4.12.2 Session key encapsulation and recovery policy and practices

Not applicable.

Action will be taken to safeguard ISRG and its Subscribers whenever ISRG Trusted Contributors, whether through negligence or malicious intent, fail to comply with ISRG policies including this CP/CPS.

Actions taken in response to non-compliance may include termination, removal from trusted roles, or reporting to legal authorities.

Once management becomes aware of non-compliance the Trusted Contributor(s) in question will be removed from trusted roles until a review of their actions is complete.

### 5.3.7 Independent Contractor Controls

Independent contractors who are assigned to perform Trusted Roles are subject to the duties and requirements specified for such roles in this CP/CPS. This includes those described in Section 5.3. Potential sanctions for unauthorized activities by independent contractors are described in Section 5.3.6.

### 5.3.8 Documentation supplied to personnel

Trusted Contributors are provided with all documentation necessary to perform their duties. This always includes, at a minimum, a copy of the ISRG CP/CPS and Information Security Policy.

## 5.4 Audit logging procedures

### 5.4.1 Types of events recorded

Audit logs are generated for all events related to CA security (physical and logical) and certificate issuance. Logs are automatically generated whenever possible. When it is necessary to manually log information, logs are kept on paper with written confirmation from a witness and securely stored. All audit logs, electronic or otherwise, shall be retained and made available to compliance auditors upon request.

At a minimum, each audit record includes:

* Date and time of entry;
* Identity of the person (or machine) making the entry; and
* Description of the entry.

### 5.4.2 Frequency for Processing and Archiving Audit Logs

No stipulation.

### 5.4.6 Audit Log Accumulation System (internal vs. external)

Audit data is automatically generated and reported/recorded by operating systems, CA software applications, and network devices. Systems are in place to ensure proper reporting and recording of audit data, and the failure of such systems may lead to suspension of CA services until proper audit log reporting is restored.

### 5.4.7 Notification to event-causing subject

No stipulation.

### 5.4.8 Vulnerability assessments

Audit logs are monitored by Trusted Contributors, including operations and engineering staff. Anomalies indicating attempted breaches of CA security are reported and investigated.

Internal and external vulnerability scans occur at least every three months.

Extensive vulnerability assessments for ISRG infrastructure are conducted at least annually by qualified third parties.

ISRG Security Officers perform a risk assessment at least annually. This risk assessment:

1. Identifies foreseeable internal and external threats that could result in unauthorized access, disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of any Certificate Data or Certificate Management Processes;

2. Assesses the likelihood and potential damage of these threats, taking into consideration the sensitivity of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes; and

3. Assesses the sufficiency of the policies, procedures, information systems, technology, and other arrangements that the CA has in place to counter such threats.

## 5.5 Records archival

### 5.5.1 Types of records archived

ISRG archives all audit logs, the contents of which are described in Section 5.4.1. ISRG also archives other documents and information critical to understanding the historical security and performance of the CA's duties.

### 5.5.2 Retention period for archive

Archived records are retained for at least the period required by Section 5.5.2 of the Baseline Requirements.

### 5.5.3 Protection of archive

Archives are protected from unauthorized modification or destruction by strong security and environmental controls.

### 5.5.4 Archive backup procedures

Archives are backed up regularly.

### 5.5.5 Requirements for time-stamping of records

Records are time-stamped as they are created.

Machine-created records use system time, which is synchronized automatically with third-party time sources. Machines without network access have the time set manually.

Manual records use a manually entered date and time, complete with time zone in use.

### 5.5.6 Archive collection system (internal or external)

No stipulation.

### 5.5.7 Procedures to obtain and verify archive information

No stipulation.

## 5.6 Key changeover

When a CA certificate is nearing expiration, a key changeover procedure is used to transition to a new CA certificate. The following steps constitute a key changeover procedure:

1. Some time prior to CA certificate expiration, the private key associated with the expiring certificate is no longer used to sign new certificates. It is only used to sign CRLs and OCSP responses.

2. A new key pair is generated and a new CA certificate is created containing the new key pair's public key. This new key pair is used to sign new certificates.

3. If necessary or desired, the old private key associated with the expiring certificate may be used to cross-sign the new certificate.

## 5.7 Compromise and disaster recovery

### 5.7.1 Incident and compromise handling procedures

ISRG has created and maintains incident response procedures for a range of potential compromise and disaster situations. Such situations include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, security incidents, and equipment failure. Incident response plans are reviewed, potentially updated, and tested on at least an annual basis.

### 5.7.2 Recovery Procedures if Computing resources, software, and/or data are corrupted

In the event that computing resources, software, and/or data are corrupted or otherwise damaged, ISRG will assess the situation, including its impact on CA integrity and security, and take appropriate action. CA operations may be suspended until mitigation is complete. Subscribers may be notified if corruption or damage has a material impact on the service provided to them.

### 5.7.3 Recovery Procedures after Key Compromise

In the event that an ISRG CA Private Key is compromised, or suspected to be compromised, ISRG will immediately launch a thorough investigation. Forensic evidence will be collected and secured as quickly as possible. If it cannot be determined with a high degree of certainty that the private key in question was not compromised, then the following steps may be taken in whatever order ISRG Security Officers deem most appropriate:

* Certificates relying on the private key in question will be revoked.
* ISRG will notify root programs relying on the integrity of the key in question.
* ISRG will notify Subscribers relying on the integrity of the key in question.

### 5.7.4 Business continuity capabilities after a disaster

ISRG maintains multiple geographically diverse facilities, each of which is capable of operating ISRG CA systems independently. In the event that a disaster entirely disables one facility, ISRG CA operations will fail over to another facility.

## 5.8 CA or RA termination

In the event that ISRG CA services are to be terminated:

* All affected parties, including root programs and Subscribers, will be provided with notice as far in advance as reasonably possible.
* The ISRG PMA will create and review a termination plan.

If a suitable successor entity exists, the following steps will be taken:

* ISRG CA Private Keys, records, logs, and other critical documentation will be transferred to the successor organization in a secure and compliant manner.
* Arrangements will be made for compliant continuation of CA responsibilities.

If a suitable successor entity does not exist, the following steps will be taken:

* All certificates issued will be revoked and final CRLs will be published.
* ISRG CA Private Keys will be destroyed.
* CA records, logs, and other critical documentation will be transferred to a third party or government entity with appropriate legal controls in place to protect information while allowing its use in compliance with relevant policies and the law.

# 6. TECHNICAL SECURITY CONTROLS

## 6.1 Key pair generation and installation

### 6.1.1 Key pair generation

ISRG CA Private Keys are generated by HSMs meeting the requirements of Section 6.2.1. This occurs during a ceremony meeting the requirements of this CP/CPS.

See the Let's Encrypt Subscriber Agreement for information regarding Subscriber key pair generation.

### 6.1.2 Private key delivery to subscriber

ISRG never generates or has access to Subscriber Private Keys.

### 6.1.3 Public key delivery to certificate issuer

Subscriber Public Keys are communicated to ISRG electronically via the ACME protocol.

### 6.1.4 CA public key delivery to relying parties

ISRG Public Keys are provided to Relying Parties as part of browser, operating system, or other software trusted root certificate lists.

ISRG Public Keys are also available in the Certificate Repository.

### 6.1.5 Key sizes

ISRG Root CA RSA Private Keys are at least 4096 bits in length.

ISRG Root CA ECDSA Private Keys are at least 384 bits in length.

ISRG Subordinate CA RSA Private Keys are at least 2048 bits in length.

ISRG Subordinate CA ECDSA Private Keys are at least 384 bits in length.

### 6.1.6 Public key parameters generation and quality checking

ISRG uses HSMs conforming to FIPS 186-4, capable of providing random number generation and on-board creation of at least 2048-bit RSA keys and at least 384-bit ECDSA keys.

Per NIST SP 800‐89 (<https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-89.pdf>), section 5.3.3, the CA ensures that:

  - the public exponent of any RSA key used in a DV-SSL Certificate is in the range between 2<sup>16</sup>+1 and 2<sup>256</sup>-1, and
  - the modulus of such a certificate is an odd number, not the power of a prime, and has no factors smaller than 752.

### 6.1.7 Key usage purposes (as per X.509 v3 key usage field)

See Section 7, Certificate Profiles.

## 6.2 Private Key Protection and Cryptographic Module Engineering Controls

### 6.2.1 Cryptographic module standards and controls

ISRG uses HSMs meeting FIPS 140-2 Level 3 (or higher) requirements.

### 6.2.2 Private key (n out of m) multi-person control

ISRG has put into place security mechanisms which require multiple people performing in Trusted Roles in order to access ISRG CA Private Keys, both physically and logically. This is true for all copies of Private Keys, in production or backups, on-site or off-site.

### 6.2.3 Private key escrow

ISRG does not escrow CA Private Keys and does not provide such a service for Subscribers.

### 6.2.4 Private key backup

Critical ISRG CA Private Keys are backed up both on-site and off-site, in multiple geographic locations, under multi-person control.

### 6.2.5 Private key archival

ISRG does not archive private keys.

### 6.2.6 Private key transfer into or from a cryptographic module

ISRG CA Private Keys are generated inside HSMs and are only transferred between HSMs for redundancy or backup purposes. When transferred, keys are encrypted prior to leaving HSMs and unwrapped only inside destination HSMs. Keys never exist in plain text form outside of HSMs.

### 6.2.7 Private key storage on cryptographic module

ISRG CA Private Keys are stored on HSMs meeting the requirements stated in Section 6.2.1.

### 6.2.8 Activating Private Keys

ISRG CA Private Keys are always stored on HSMs and activated using the mechanisms provided by the HSM manufacturer.

### 6.2.9 Deactivating Private Keys

ISRG CA Private Keys are always stored on HSMs and deactivated using the mechanisms provided by the HSM manufacturer.

### 6.2.10 Destroying Private Keys

ISRG CA Private Keys are destroyed by Trusted Contributors using a FIPS 140-2 (or higher) validated zeroize method provided by the HSMs storing the keys. Physical destruction of the HSM is not required.

See the Let's Encrypt Subscriber Agreement for information regarding Subscriber private key destruction.

### 6.2.11 Cryptographic Module Capabilities

See Section 6.2.1.

## 6.3 Other aspects of key pair management

### 6.3.1 Public key archival

See Section 5.5.

### 6.3.2 Certificate operational periods and key pair usage periods

The validity periods of ISRG Root CA, Subordinate CA, and Subscriber Certificates are profiled in Section 7 of this document.

ISRG Root and Subordinate CA key pairs have lifetimes corresponding to their certificates. Subscriber key pairs may be re-used indefinitely provided that there is no suspicion or confirmation of Private Key compromise.

## 6.4 Activation data

### 6.4.1 Activation data generation and installation

Activation data used to activate ISRG CA Private Keys is generated during a key ceremony. Activation data is then transferred to the person who will use it or the place it will be stored.

### 6.4.2 Activation data protection

Activation data is protected from unauthorized disclosure via both physical and logical means.

### 6.4.3 Other aspects of activation data

No stipulation.

## 6.5 Computer security controls

### 6.5.1 Specific computer security technical requirements

ISRG CA infrastructure and systems are appropriately secured in order to protect CA software and data from unauthorized access or modification. Access to systems is secured via multi-factor authentication whenever possible. Security updates are applied in a timely fashion. Vulnerability scans are run regularly.

### 6.5.2 Computer security rating

No stipulation.

## 6.6 Life cycle technical controls

### 6.6.1 System development controls

ISRG has developed policies and procedures to effectively manage the acquisition and development of its CA systems.

ISRG CA hardware and software is dedicated solely to performing CA functions.

Vendor selection includes an evaluation of reputation in the market, ability to deliver a quality product, vulnerability history, and the likelihood of remaining viable in the future. Physical product deliveries are received by Trusted Contributors and inspected for evidence of tampering. HSMs are shipped in tamper-evident packaging and tamper bag serial numbers are confirmed with the vendor upon receipt.

ISRG maintains a CA testing environment separate from the production environment. The testing environment reasonably emulates the production environment but does not have access to ISRG CA Private Keys used in trusted certificates. The purpose of this testing environment is to allow extensive but safe testing of software and systems that are or will be deployed to the CA production environment.

ISRG has developed and maintains appropriate change control policies and procedures to be followed any time CA systems are modified. Changes to ISRG CA systems require review by qualified Trusted Personnel who are different from the person requesting the change. Change requests are documented, as are any subsequent required reviews or approvals.

When ISRG develops software to be used in CA operations, software development policies are put into place and methodologies are followed in order to ensure software quality and integrity. This always includes a requirement for peer review of code changes. Code commit privileges are granted only to qualified and trusted contributors. Nobody with the ability to deploy software to ISRG PKI systems (e.g. PKI Administrators) may have the ability to unilaterally commit code to core CA software. The reverse is also true.

### 6.6.2 Security management controls

ISRG has mechanisms in place to control and monitor security-related configuration of CA systems. Equipment and software is installed and configured using a documented change control process. Software integrity is verified upon deployment using checksums.

### 6.6.3 Life cycle security controls

No stipulation.

## 6.7 Network security controls

ISRG implements reasonable network security safeguards and controls to prevent unauthorized access to CA systems and infrastructure. ISRG complies with the CA/Browser Forum's Network and Certificate System Security Requirements.

ISRG's network is multi-tiered and utilizes the principle of defense in depth.

Firewalls and other critical CA systems are configured based on a necessary-traffic-only allowlisting policy whenever possible.

ISRG Root CA Private Keys are stored offline in a secure manner.

## 6.8 Time-stamping

See Section 5.5.5.
